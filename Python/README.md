# Python Basics

These are the Python practice files I worked on when I first started learning, before moving into Machine Learning.  
I wrote them some time ago, but Iâ€™m uploading them now as the first step in documenting my ML journey.  

The files are raw and not very organized, but they reflect the actual way I learned - experimenting, trying out ideas, and building a base in Python.  
This is the starting point before I get into more structured ML related work.
